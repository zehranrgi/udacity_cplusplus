# udacity_cplusplus_intro

There are 13 parts in the course. In the notebooks, there are some links for better understanding the concepts and there are example codes to cover the usage of them. 

[LESSON 1](https://github.com/zehranrgi/udacity_cplusplus/blob/main/intro_cplusplus_lesson1.cpp)
The Basics

You will learn Program structure, header files, IO Compilation and Execution.

[LESSON 2](https://github.com/zehranrgi/udacity_cplusplus/blob/main/arithmetic_operation_lesson2.cpp)
Arithmetic Operations

You will learn the most commonly used arithmetic operations in C++.

[LESSON 3](https://github.com/zehranrgi/udacity_cplusplus/blob/main/control_flow_lesson3.cpp)
Control Flow

You will learn if, if-else, while, do-while, and switch statements.

[LESSON 4](https://github.com/zehranrgi/udacity_cplusplus/blob/main/pointers_lesson4.cpp)
Pointers

This lesson is a quick review of pointers. We discuss them here because we'll use them in the Arrays lesson.

[LESSON 5](https://github.com/zehranrgi/udacity_cplusplus/blob/main/arrays_lesson5.cpp)
Array

We will do a preliminary exploration of two dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.

[LESSON 6](https://github.com/zehranrgi/udacity_cplusplus/blob/main/funct_lesson6.cpp)
Functions

Functions with and without return values, with and without parameters, and passing by reference are demonstrated and used in this lesson.

[LESSON 7](https://github.com/zehranrgi/udacity_cplusplus/blob/main/class_lesson7.cpp)
Classes

This lesson is a basic introduction to classes. You will practice creating and instantiating classes in this lesson.

[LESSON 8](https://github.com/zehranrgi/udacity_cplusplus/blob/main/overloading_lesson8.cpp)
Overloading

We introduce overloading functions in this lesson as a segue into templates.

[LESSON 9](https://github.com/zehranrgi/udacity_cplusplus/blob/main/generic_programming_lesson9.cpp)
Generic Programming

We introduce generic programming through templates. First function templates then class templates. 

[LESSON 10](https://github.com/zehranrgi/udacity_cplusplus/blob/main/inheritance_lesson10.cpp)
Inheritance

[LESSON 11](https://github.com/zehranrgi/udacity_cplusplus/blob/main/polymorphism_lesson11.cpp)
Polymorphism

[LESSON 12](https://github.com/zehranrgi/udacity_cplusplus/blob/main/vectors_lesson12.cpp)
Vectors
